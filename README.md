# ArachnID

This project provides a tool for identifying spiders found within the home. This project provides an Android application with which the user can photograph a spider and receive immediate information about that spiderâ€™s species, venom status, and habitat. The identification software is based on a Convolutional Neural Network trained on images of North Carolinian spiders, allowing for automatic species classification

## Usage

This repository supplies the project's TensorFlow, Keras based convolutional neural network model. The main model is written in VGG16_BF_final.ipynb.
The vgg16_bottle files are hosted on the PythonAnywhere web server, providing the classification functionality to the web application.
Tangential program files and image data used in the project are included here as well.

For installation of the Android application, visit the main application repository:
